# Snow Fence Simulation

## The Problem
Snow drifts suck. If you live somewhere windy and snowy, like me, you've probably had to dig out your driveway constantly. It's a pain. Snow fences are suppose to help, but how do you figure out where to put one to keep snow from piling up where you don't want it?

## What I'm Doing
I'm making a computer program that can show how wind and snow interact with a snow fence. The idea is to use it to:

- See how wind slows down because of the fence.
- Figure out where the snow will drop and build up.
- Try out different fence setups to see what works best.

## How It Works
I'm keeping it simple to start. The program will:

1. Model the Wind: Show how the wind slows down when it hits the fence. It'll use some math to do this.
2. Simulate Snow: It'll track snow particles in the wind and show where they land.
3. Make a Picture: It'll draw a map showing the wind and the snow buildup so you can see what's going on.

## Features
- Flat Ground: No hills or bumps to make things complicated (yet).
- Change the Fence: You can mess with the height and where you put the fence.
- See Snow: Watch how the snow moves and where it piles up.

## What's Next
Here’s what I’m planning to do:

- Write a Python program to handle all this.
- Make it so you can change stuff like wind speed and how heavy the snow is.
- Later on, I might add hills or more fences to see how that changes things.

## Who Might Care
- People like me who are tired of shoveling.
- Engineers and smart people who study this kind of thing.
- Anyone curious about snow and wind.

## Tools I'm Using
- Python: 'Cause it's good for this kind of thing.
- NumPy: Helps with math stuff.
- Matplotlib: Makes the pictures.

## Cool Stuff to Add Later
- Make it 3D so you can see what happens on hills.
- Use real weather data to make it more accurate.
- Add fences with holes or different designs to see how they work.

This is just the start. Hopefully, it’ll help me (and maybe you) figure out how to stop snow drifts from making winter even worse!
